# 👋 Hi there, I'm [Marlon Macharia](https://linkedin.com/in/marlon-macharia/)

### Founder & CEO — [Bombay Softwares Limited (Kenya)](https://bombaysoftwares.co.ke)
**Backend Software Engineer | Python Specialist | Data Analytics Practitioner**

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with a strong specialization in the **Python ecosystem**, particularly **Django-based backend systems**. I design and build **scalable backend application logic**, architect production-ready systems, and use **data analytics** to solve real operational and business problems.

Alongside Python, I’m currently learning **Go**, focusing on performance-oriented backend services and deeper system-level design.

## ⚙️ Engineering Philosophy

My approach to engineering is grounded in **first-principles thinking** — breaking problems down to what actually matters, eliminating unnecessary complexity, and building only what moves the system forward.

I believe in:

- **Shipping early and often** over over-engineering  
- **Building fast, then iterating based on real usage**  
- **Testing assumptions in production**, with proper monitoring and rollback strategies  
- **Simple systems that evolve**, rather than perfect systems that never ship  
- **Engineering as a feedback loop**, not a one-time design exercise

## 🐍 Backend Engineering (Python-Centric)

Python is my primary language and the foundation of most systems I build:

- **Django** – Core framework for business-critical backend systems  
- **REST APIs** – Authentication, authorization, permissions, and domain-driven logic  
- **Backend Architecture** – Modular apps, service layers, and reusable components  
- **Performance & Stability** – Query optimization, caching, background tasks

---

## 📊 Data Analytics & Business Intelligence

I combine backend engineering with data analytics to improve systems and operations:

- **SQL** – Reporting, analytics, and performance tuning  
- **Python Data Stack** – Pandas, NumPy  
- **BI Tools** – Power BI, Tableau  
- **Jupyter** – Exploratory analysis and prototyping

## 🏗️ Currently Building

### ◉ [CBC AI](https://cbcai.co.ke) — Lead Software Engineer

I’m leading the engineering of **CBC AI**, a platform focused on **optimizing Kenyan school operations** end-to-end.

We are building systems that cover:
- **Academic management** — curriculum, assessments, performance tracking  
- **Financial operations** — fees, payments, reporting, and reconciliation  
- **Operational systems** — including **low-level Biometric and RFID-based solutions**  
- **Backend services & APIs** designed to scale across multiple institutions
